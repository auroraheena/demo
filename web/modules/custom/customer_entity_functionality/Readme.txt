Custom module covers:

1. Create a custom page (Customer list) with its own route (/customer_list) that renders the results of the “Customers list” view.

2. Added the ability to filter the view by customer id using an argument  - /customer_list/(customer_id)

3. CSV parser to create/update Customer entities from the .csv file by a cron task every hour.
